            Mental Health Counselor and Aspiring Coder

        <p>
          While I have been coding and programming as early as 1986, I have established myself vocationally as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor.
          I started programming on Apple II's and IBM PC's as a kid - almost exclusively in BASIC. I did spend some time in the 1990's with Logo
          and HyperCard. While computers and technology remained an interest through my adolescence and young adulthood, more time was spent with
          vocational studies and pursuits. While working at <a href="https://sound.health">Sound</a> (a Seattle community health clinic), I have established and continue to maintain a
          successful private practice, <a href="https://www.envisiontherapies.net">Envision Therapies</a>. Person centered work along with a strong understanding of computers and software has made
          for a healthy balance in my life. I have been working developing skills in Unity and C#, as well as Java. Now, I'm building my web skills
          and reaquanting myself with HTML.
